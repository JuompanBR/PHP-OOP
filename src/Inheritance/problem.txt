Exercise 3: Inheritance 
Concepts Covered: Parent & Child Classes, Overriding Methods 
• Create a Vehicle base class with properties: $color and $speed. 
• Add a method describe() that prints a basic description of the 
vehicle. 
• Create a Bike class that extends Vehicle and adds a property 
$type (e.g., "mountain", "road"). 
• Override the describe() method to include the bike type. 
Exercise 4: Polymorphism 
Concepts Covered: Method Overriding, In

Define an interface Shape with a method getArea(). 
• Create Rectangle and Circle classes that implement Shape. 
• Implement the getArea() method in both classes (Rectangle 
using width × height, Circle using π × r²). 
• Instantiate both classes and display their areas. 
Exercise 5: Abstract Classes 
Concepts Covered: Abstract Classes & Methods 
• Create an abstract class Employee with properties $name and 
$salary. 
• Add an abstract method calculateBonus(). 
• Create two subclasses Manager and Developer, each 
implementing calculateBonus() with different logic. 
• Instantiate both subclasses and calculate bonu
